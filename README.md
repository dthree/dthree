I'm the Co-Founder & CTO at MindCloud, a rapidly growing B2B startup in the integration space. I've been writing production software for 16 years with an emphasis on designing and building data-heavy platforms from the ground up.

I had fun building some original OSS projects in the past for the Node community:

- [Vorpal](https://github.com/dthree/vorpal) - Interactive CLI framework for Node
- [Cash](https://github.com/dthree/cash) - Cross-platform unix coreutils in Javascript
- [Vantage](https://github.com/dthree/vantage) - Distributed, realtime CLI for live Node apps
